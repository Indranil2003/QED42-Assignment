# Evaluation Framework for Retrieval and Chat Applications

## Overview
This framework is designed to systematically evaluate the performance of search and retrieval systems, with a specific focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. The goal is to establish a set of metrics that assess the quality of both retrieval and generation components, helping to differentiate the performance of various embedding models and RAG configurations. The framework provides insights into retrieval accuracy, generation fidelity, and overall response coherence.

## Task 1: Evaluation of Embedding Models for Search and Retrieval

### Approach
To evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of embedding models, we focused on the following metrics:

- *Precision@K*: Measures the proportion of relevant documents within the top K results, ensuring high retrieval accuracy.
- *Recall@K*: Evaluates coverage, showing how well the system captures all relevant documents.
- *Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)*: Reflects the ranking quality of relevant documents, ensuring relevant documents appear as high as possible in the results.

### Challenges and Solutions
A major challenge was balancing precision and recall. High recall can introduce irrelevant results, reducing overall precision. To address this, a filtering step was applied to minimize noise, ensuring that only high-relevance documents are used for further evaluation. This approach enabled a balanced retrieval module, optimizing both precision and recall.

## Task 2: Comprehensive Evaluation of RAG Systems

### Approach
The evaluation of RAG systems includes metrics for retrieval quality, generation quality, and overall coherence. These metrics help assess the retrieval module’s relevance as well as the generation module’s ability to produce contextually appropriate responses.

- *Retrieval Quality*: Using Precision@K and Recall@K, we evaluated how accurately relevant documents were retrieved.
- *Generation Quality*: BLEU and ROUGE scores were used to measure lexical similarity between generated responses and reference answers, ensuring generation accuracy.
- *Overall System Coherence and Relevance*: BERTScore (for semantic similarity) and human evaluations were incorporated to capture coherence, relevance, and fluency.

### Challenges and Solutions
- *Balancing Retrieval Precision and Recall*: A relevance-based filtering mechanism was implemented to avoid low-relevance noise in the generation input, ensuring high-quality retrieval.
- *Lexical vs. Semantic Alignment*: BERTScore added a semantic layer to the evaluation, complementing BLEU and ROUGE to capture contextual relevance even in lexically varied outputs.
- *Subjective Nature of Human Evaluation*: A scoring rubric with multiple raters was used to ensure consistency in human evaluation, providing reliable scores for coherence and relevance.
- *Integrated Evaluation for Retrieval and Generation*: A composite metric was developed to combine weighted retrieval and generation scores, offering a unified performance metric for system output.

## Summary
This evaluation framework provides a rigorous methodology to assess search and RAG systems by balancing retrieval accuracy, generation fidelity, and overall coherence. Metrics such as Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR, BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, along with human evaluations, create a comprehensive view of each system’s strengths and weaknesses. This structured approach allows for model differentiation, optimization, and continuous improvements to meet user expectations in real-world applications.

## Usage

Here is an example of how to apply this framework in Python to calculate key metrics:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu
from rouge_score import rouge_scorer
from bert_score import score as bert_score

# Example data: ground_truth and predictions (update with actual data)
ground_truth = [...]
predictions = [...]

# Function for calculating Precision@K and Recall@K
def calculate_precision_recall_k(ground_truth, predictions, k):
    relevant_docs = ground_truth[:k]
    retrieved_docs = predictions[:k]
    
    precision = precision_score(relevant_docs, retrieved_docs, average='binary')
    recall = recall_score(relevant_docs, retrieved_docs, average='binary')
    return precision, recall

# Example usage for BLEU score
reference = ["This is a reference answer"]
candidate = ["This is a generated response"]
bleu_score = sentence_bleu([reference], candidate)

# Example usage for ROUGE score
scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True)
rouge_scores = scorer.score(" ".join(reference), " ".join(candidate))

# Example usage for BERTScore
P, R, F1 = bert_score(candidate, reference, lang="en")

print("Precision@K:", calculate_precision_recall_k(ground_truth, predictions, k=5))
print("BLEU Score:", bleu_score)
print("ROUGE Scores:", rouge_scores)
print("BERTScore F1:", F1.mean().item())
